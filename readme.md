# [Global Azure Bootcamp 2015] (http://gwabmauritius.azurewebsites.net/)

In April of 2013 we held the first Global Windows Azure Bootcamp at more than 90 locations around the globe! In March 2014 we topped that with 136 locations! This year we are again doing a one day deep dive class to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Azure. In addition to this great learning opportunity we will have another set of hands on labs.

This project is the playground of the [Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community] (http://www.meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/).
